The Simulation Code of Propagation-induced Spectro-polarimetric Properties

The code file simulation.py contains two main parts: three classes and simulation code. The GFR (Generalized Faraday Rotation) class, the PEPWs (Propagation Effects of the Polarized Wave) class, and a likelihood class of PEPWs.
